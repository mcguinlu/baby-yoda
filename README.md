# Baby Yoda

This repository contains the detailed brick requirements and building
instructions for creating your own Baby Yoda Lego model. The model was
built using the [`brickr`](https://github.com/ryantimpe/brickr) R
package, and was adapted from the Baby Yoda model originally designed by
[Ryan Timppe](https://github.com/ryantimpe) (see
[here](https://gist.github.com/ryantimpe/3893fdd0f94138d027bae35bf38b57c7)
for the code for that model). The adaption was necessary, as the
original model contained a number of “floating bricks” (i.e. bricks that
are not supported by another brick from either above or below), which
work fine when rendering the model in R but cannot be used in a physical
version.
