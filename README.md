# Baby Yoda

This repository contains the detailed brick requirements and building
instructions for creating your own Baby Yoda Lego model. The model was
built using the [`brickr`](https://github.com/ryantimpe/brickr) R
package, and was adapted from the Baby Yoda model originally designed by
[Ryan Timpe](https://github.com/ryantimpe) (see
[here](https://gist.github.com/ryantimpe/3893fdd0f94138d027bae35bf38b57c7)
for the code for that model). The adaption was necessary, as the
original model contained a number of “floating bricks” (i.e. bricks that
are not supported by another brick from either above or below), which
work fine when rendering the model in R but cannot be used in a physical
version.

This version was designed to work with a electromagnetic levitation
display to give it a true-to-life feel. I used [this
one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07YKY6K8J/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1),
but it will work with display with a flating magnet diameter of \<5.5cm.

# Build pieces and instructions

## Build pieces

These are the pieces you will need to build your own Baby Yoda. These
can be acquired from the Pick A Brick service on the Lego store website.
The total cost for all pieces included in this model was \~£30 pounds.

## Instructions

The instructions below will guide you through building your own Baby
Yoda, using the pieces detailed above. It can be awkward to get some of
the pieces to work together when building up, as they are supported by a
brick on the next level up. In this case, a useful tip is to try
building down (i.e. descending through the steps).
